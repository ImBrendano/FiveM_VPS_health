To use, create a new file using the command "vi healthcheck.sh" or "nano healthchech.sh" depending on your distro

for vi paste it, hit esc and type :wq and hit enter
for nano paste and hit shift O, then enter. After, hit ctrl X

next use the command "sudo chmod +x healthcheck.sh"
finally, to run type ./healthcheck.sh (this can be different depending on distro)

either this ^^ or upload the .sh with FTP and chmod it. That works also


For setting up a crontab ask chatgpt, I'm to lazy to write a guide currently.

ENJOY! Let me know if it comes in handy for you, took me an extra hour or two to put it together for the community :)
